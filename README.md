This repository contains a F\* development made during my M2 internship at Inria Paris.

It contains implementations of basic data structures in Low\* and Steel and an alternative
verification method for Steel programs, using the generation of a functional translation.
It does not work with recent versions of F\* and it uses a custom version of F\* after
[c37b4fe](https://github.com/857b/stageM2/commit/c37b4fe14d912758eca96c03cb0577beb404dc2e).
